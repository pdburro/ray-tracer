# Ray Tracer

A C++ class project following [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, and Steve Hollasch.

## Current status

Section 3 implemented: vec3 vector math, point3/color aliases, and integer PPM color output. The renderer preserves the rainbow experiment and reports progress. Next: Section 4, rays and a simple camera.

## Project layout

```text
src/main.cpp     Rainbow renderer and progress output
src/vec3.h       Vector math and point3 alias
src/color.h      Color alias and PPM pixel output
CMakeLists.txt   C++ build configuration
renders/        Generated images (ignored by Git)
```

Add headers under `src/` as you reach the corresponding concepts in the guide.

## Build and run

Requirements: CMake 3.16 or newer and a C++17 compiler. On Windows, Visual Studio Build Tools with the Desktop development with C++ workload is one option.

From this folder in PowerShell:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

With a Visual Studio generator, run:

```powershell
.\build\Release\ray_tracer.exe
```

With a single-configuration generator, the executable is usually `build/ray_tracer.exe` on Windows or `build/ray_tracer` on macOS/Linux. Configure those builds with `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.

Save a render in PowerShell using:

```powershell
.\build\Release\ray_tracer.exe | Out-File -Encoding ascii renders\image.ppm
```

Keep progress messages on `std::clog` so they do not enter the image file. Use a viewer that supports PPM to inspect the result.

## Checkpoints

Check off each milestone after building, running, and inspecting its result. These follow the guide's progression:

- [x] 00 — Create the repository scaffold and build configuration.
- [x] 01 — Build and run the starter locally.
- [x] 02 — Output an Image: save and inspect the PPM gradient; add progress reporting.
- [x] 03 — The vec3 Class: add vector operations and color output.
- [ ] 04 — Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background: render a sky gradient.
- [ ] 05 — Adding a Sphere: render a sphere silhouette.
- [ ] 06 — Surface Normals and Multiple Objects: visualize normals and add a ground sphere.
- [ ] 07 — Moving Camera Code Into Its Own Class: preserve the rendered scene.
- [ ] 08 — Antialiasing: compare sampled edges with the earlier image.
- [ ] 09 — Diffuse Materials: add diffuse scattering and gamma correction.
- [ ] 10 — Metal: add reflective and fuzzy materials.
- [ ] 11 — Dielectrics: add glass and refraction.
- [ ] 12 — Positionable Camera: render the scene from a new viewpoint.
- [ ] 13 — Defocus Blur: demonstrate depth of field.
- [ ] 14 — Where Next?: render the final scene and record settings.

## Version control workflow

After finishing a checkpoint, update its checkbox and record what you verified in the log below. Review changes before staging them:

```powershell
git status
git diff
git add README.md src CMakeLists.txt .gitignore renders/.gitkeep
git commit -m "Complete checkpoint 02: first PPM image"
git push -u origin main
```

Use a commit message matching the checkpoint you actually completed. After the first push, `git push` is enough. Optionally mark a verified checkpoint with `git tag checkpoint-02` and publish that tag with `git push origin checkpoint-02`.

Generated images and build files are ignored. To preserve a milestone image, deliberately copy it into a tracked `docs/images/` folder and add it to your commit.

## Progress log

| Checkpoint | Date | Verification / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 00 | 2026-09-10 | Starter files added; compilation has not yet been verified. |

| 01-03 | 2026-09-29 | Release build succeeded; generated a 256x256 rainbow PPM and checked pixel count and integer channel ranges. Added Section 3 vector/color helpers and progress reporting. |

For future entries, record image settings, what changed, and any remaining issues.

## Reference and attribution

The linked book is the learning reference for this project. The interfaces and math in src/vec3.h and src/color.h follow Section 3, implemented with Codex assistance. Credit any adapted code as it is added, and follow your class's rules for outside code and assistance.
